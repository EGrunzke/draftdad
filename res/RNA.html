Not only is this a huge flash flyer that is cheap and great at ambushing, it can also save you in even the most dire situations. You could take a lot away from this card and it would still be great, which is a sign of a true bomb. If you draw this early, you can pick off an attacker and start smashing the opponent. Later in the game, it saves you from lethal, and you may even want to trade this off (or chump) so that you can go back up to 10 on your next turn. This is a great card, and one that does well in almost any situation.</p>

If you can get +3/+3, the card is quite strong, and it's not that hard to imagine getting there.</p>

The only thing that quenches my zeal a little is that both Azorius and Orzhov have some defensive aspects to them, which makes combat tricks a bit less appealing. Still, the rate on this is quite good, and I suspect it'll be a card you're happy to play.</p>

In the best case scenario, it leads to a ton of damage, both via the extra power and the fact that it enables your 2/2s to attack into 3/3s. The more aggressive you are, the better this gets, but it's a fine playable in your average midrange deck too. It is very important to have a curve to maximize this, so focus on getting good 2s and 3s if you have a couple of Stalwarts.</p>

Where it gets interesting is when you have ways to add more counters, as it gives you more looting triggers, which is a powerful engine. I'd look to combine this with Combine Guildmage, which will give you a steady stream of counters and action.</p>

The casting cost is obviously the issue here, as the card is quite powerful. A 2-mana counter that buffs one of your units and has +1/+1 counter synergies is great, but UU means you won't be able to cast this turn 2 some of the time, and that's a big hit. Once you're looking at 9+ blue sources, I'd bump this up a little, but early in the Draft I wouldn't prioritize it.</p>

It costs a lot of mana to steal a creature, and leaves the opponent with a permanent scry 1 each turn. If the opponent has blue mana, things get worse, as they might start swapping this back and forth. That can lead to a weird lock where that's all players do, but even then I don't think this is really a card you want in your deck. If your opponent has insane creatures you can't deal with and isn't playing blue, maybe this is a sideboard card, but I'm not really going to be keeping an eye on this one.</p>

I'd play this in any deck with even two Gates, as a 1/3 that draws a card on damage makes all your bounce and removal spells very dangerous. Once you have 5+ Gates it becomes a sick threat and can take over a game with ease. Don't assume only the Gate deck wants this—it'll go quickly in most any Draft.</p>

Paying 6 mana (4 of which is blue) to steal one creature is still pretty good, and most decks can swing that as long as you play like 10 Islands. Where this becomes a flat-out bomb is when you make a ramp/control deck with a lot of defensive measures, and reliably can cast this to take two creatures. That's almost impossible to beat, and a very big incentive to build such a deck.</p>

1. Fast aggro decks where you're focused on winning the early/midgame
2. Control decks that need low drops, especially if they have 1-2 Prying Eyes to discard late game Quenches.

The first is that it costs 2 instead of the usual 3, which is a real step forward. The second is that spectacle makes the opponent more prone to block, so you'll have more opportunities to use this, and if you think of this as “sacrifice a creature to kill any creature it's blocking or blocked by,” it becomes a lot more appealing. Plus, the combo with Dagger Caster is very real, and quite effective.</p>

On the surface, it looks like an aggressive card where you take their biggest blocker and whack them over the head with it. As threatening as that may be, that's not the best use for this, and this is a marginal aggressive card at best (because it's pretty situational, and when it isn't good, it does basically nothing). Where Act of Treason really shines (and gets a 3.0 rating) is in a deck with multiple ways to sacrifice creatures. Then it turns into a removal spell that gives you a free attack and the benefit of the sacrifice outlet, which is quite powerful. It's also a card you'll get late, because it's rare that anyone else will want it.</p>

It may start small, but it's going to be a 4/4 at worst, and will easily be a 6/6 or 8/8 at various points. The effect also lasts until your next turn, which means it can be a good blocker if needed. I wouldn't go too far in changing what creatures I play because of this, but it does get worse if you've got a bunch of 1/1s in your deck.</p>

The smaller the creature is, the more you're incentivized to choose the +1/+1 counter, so I like the riot creatures with attack triggers as a way to make the choice more interesting. Burning-Tree Vandal gives you at least one rummage, and will often trade off, which is a fine way to spend 3 mana. I'd still mostly choose to have a 3/2, but if they have a 2/2 in play you might as well haste it up and trade right away.</p>

This is excellent in any aggressive deck, and heavily pushes you toward choosing the haste mode. If you can clear their only blocker, then next turn have a removal spell to put them down to one blocker again, you probably have won the game. You can even attack with this when they have two blockers, and they will often be forced to block this and let everything else through, which turns into a ton of damage. The only thing holding this back from a 3.5 is that it's not great in anything but aggro, so if you know you're going to be aggressive, feel free to take this highly.</p>

The easiest is Bladebrand, as this is a two-card combo that wipes the opponent's board. It's a really strong pairing and both cards are fine on their own, which makes me think this is worth speculating on for that alone. This does good work on its own, as it can pick off x/1s and give you good attacks, where you send in 2/2s into 3/3s and whatnot. I'm pretty high on Dagger Caster, and suspect the Bladebrand dream is real enough that it will be an early pick.</p>

I'm actually a little cooler on X-spells than most people because Limited is fast enough these days that they aren't deal-10s, but Electrodominance gives you such a tempo boost that I'm into it. Casting this with X at 4+ isn't that hard, and can kill one of their threats plus drop a midsized threat of your own. That's good enough for me, and sometimes this will do a ludicrous amount of damage. Instant speed also leads to ambush possibilities, which is a nice bonus.</p>

Not a ton, so it's not a disaster if you have to run one, but definitely not exciting. Once you have 3+, Goblin Gathering becomes the real deal, and even gives you a reason to run some of the go-wide payoffs. I don't think this is a huge build-around, but it's a nice bit of extra action for a common.</p>

This has a good threat of activation going on, where the opponent often won't be able to block and you don't even need to spend mana. It also eventually gets to the point where you can pump it twice, making this a solid threat early and a real card late.</p>

Still, if you cast this for 1 mana it's very powerful, and note that this lasts until the end of your next turn. That gives you a good window to play the cards, including lands, and makes it closer to Divination with upside than worse than Divination. If you don't have good spectacle enablers, I would downgrade the rating, but most Rakdos/Gruul decks should be able to utilize this well enough.</p>

The activated ability is very powerful, and once you get to 8 mana it is almost unbeatable (especially given that you have a 5/5 flyer in play). The backup plan of a 4/4 haste flyer is a good one, and if they are at a low life total you may want to go down that road.</p>

In a deck with spectacle cards, Spear Spewer is an auto-play and a great way to make your deck work. That puts it into solid 3 territory because the decks that want it really want it. It isn't great in control or midrange decks without spectacle nonsense, so keep that in mind, but the effect here is powerful enough (even if symmetrical) that I'd take this early. As a side note, I don't find this kind of card (Goblin Fireslinger being the earlier example) to be very interesting when they enable spectacle/bloodthirst. The ability is just always on when this is in play, and there's nothing the opponent can do about it. That's not very good game play, and I don't see why this has to be a common at such a good rate.</p>

Unless the opponent has instant-speed interaction, it immediately gives you a pair of 3/3s, and the turn after you likely can add another Ooze to the board. That leaves you with two 4/4s and a 3/3, and it just gets better from there. If this does get answered, you traded 1-for-1 and either have a 2/2 or 3/3 left over, depending on when the opponent killed it. A card that wins the game if it isn't killed, trades advantageously against removal, and can help mount a comeback, all for 5 mana, gets a high grade in my book.</p>

By itself, it gives you six +1/+1 counters, and each counter you already have gives you a bonus one. That's a lot of stats to throw around, making this a very threatening card if you have any kind of board presence at all. This isn't the best in a control deck, as it's not great when you are behind, but in any midrange or aggressive deck it will do good work.</p>

I'm not usually high on 8-drops, but when they win you the game almost every time, I am willing to changemy tune. This easily hits for 11+ damage, and it can be much more than that if the board is stalled, which is worth the effort it takes to get to 8 mana. When you take this, focus on mana ramp and ways to survive until late, at which point the game goes from boring to boaring very quickly. They even give/have vigilance, so a non-lethal attack doesn't leave you vulnerable.</p>

Outside the dedicated Gate deck this is wildly unplayable, but once you hit 6-7+ Gates it gets pretty broken. All you need is a 4/4 and you're in the money, with anything past that being awesome. The Gate deck doesn't need finishers all that badly, but this is still a nice pickup once you're doing the thing.</p>

It works nicely with pump spells, even if you have to play them before attacking, and thrashes anyone who doesn't have a solid defense set up. I'd mostly want to play this as a 3/3, but it's pretty context-dependent—if you have the opportunity to get a nice shot in, then go for it.</p>

fits very neatly into Rakdos's strategy, and is efficient enough to always make the cut. It's a shame this doesn't work with Act of Treason
 due to the timing of the sacrifice, but this still pressures the opponent effectively. If you have this, black afterlife cards should go up in your pick order.</p>

is an effective combatant, as it can trade with anything and beats 2/x creatures in a fight thanks to deathtouch. The spectacle cost isn't a huge discount, but every now and then it'll be a nice bonus.</p>

                                            <p class="hidden_description">Clan Guildmage pushes the spears pretty well, but is somewhat lacking when you don't have a good offense lined up. That, plus the need to spend mana each turn, makes me less high on this than some of the other Guildmages. Note that the green ability puts your lands at risk, so it's not just sending in a 4/4 token if you use it.</p>

It's either a 3/3 haste or 4/4, both of which have trample, and in case that wasn't enough, this has a pump ability. That is a ton of rate and abilities, making me think this got moved from uncommon at some point in the process. Either way, I'm in a frenzy thinking about getting decks with two or three of these, as they are huge threats at any point in the game. You mostly want this as a 4/4, but there are definitely games where the haste mode is better.</p>

If you have Nikya, I'd look to play 2-4 spells max, and hope you can use them in the early game. This effect is super powerful, and I think very good. Turn 5 Nikya, turn 6 dump your hand of creatures is a nice play pattern, and it isn't like the opponent can ignore a 5/5 either, so you will unlock your spells. I could see Nikya being an even bigger bomb, deckbuilding constraints and all. Note that you can use the extra mana on adapt, which is absurd too.</p>

When you have a counterspell, you need to have it on specific turns, and Frilled Mystic will sometimes be staring at you while you have three Forests and an Island in play. That said, countering their spell is a sick 2-for-1 that leaves you with a 3/2 in play, so I'd be frilled to have this in any Simic deck. Later in the Draft, if you have 3+ Simic Gates, this probably deserves a flat 3.5.</p>

It's a great payoff, as a 7/7 trample (or greater) is a lot, so if you have 4-5 cards with counters this can be a real beating. I am a little tilted that a card with the name “Galloping” doesn't have haste, but that's a minor issue.</p>

At 6 mana, it gives you a 4/4 flying trample that draws two cards and gains 4 life, which is a card I'd already give a 4.0. This is even more flexible than that, and can be cast for larger and larger amounts. This is a splashable bomb, and you should almost always take it when you have the option to do so.</p>

You need to remember exactly what creatures are left in your deck, which is easier to do online, but upgrading your creatures by 1 mana is worth it. Plus, this impacts the board nicely, and is not easy to kill.

That's a lot of action on a card that already has a strong text box, and I'd take Kaya's Wrath
early and try to build a control deck.</p>

Deploy is a very powerful spell, and is good on its own, so adding the option of tapping down a key attacker or blocker (or just cycling early) is huge. I also like pseudo-splashing this—in Orzhov or Simic, you can just play Depose as a card, and maybe you have one Guildgate that helps cast Deploy if that ever comes up.</p>

It costs a lot of mana and is mostly symmetrical, and isn't great if you're behind (which you're more likely to be if you have a 7-drop rotting in your hand). That said, you can put something large into play or cast Emergency Powers at the end of the opponent's turn, and both of those break the symmetry somewhat. I suspect this isn't a card you want to play, but some strange control decks may be able to make use of it.</p>

It does buff some of your Azorius creatures, but spending a card on that and having it only work on a subset of creatures isn't where I want to be. Maybe I'll change my mind once someone makes the three Concordia Pegasus + three Knight-Arbiter deck, but I'm not sold right now.</p>

Warrant is a great removal spell, and is efficient enough to always be appealing. If you're at the point in the game where you don't need a 2-mana removal spell, Warden
puts a huge threat into play. This is some real chocolate and peanut butter action, and it's one of the better Azorius cards out there. I'm also amused by how many U/W vigilance flyers are in this set. What happened to the B/G vigilance flyer?</p>
